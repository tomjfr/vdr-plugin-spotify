This plugin needs pkg "spotify-client" and a spotify license applied to
the client.

Calling this plugin from the main menu, allows you to start the
spotify-client-binary from vdr with "OK" or "YELLOW".
With PLAY,PAUSE,NEXT etc. the last remembered playlist can be heard.

Using a different device with a spotify client or app, Spotify-Direct can
be used to control the vdr-plugin and to listen to your music on the same
device vdr outputs its audio to.

The plugin is stopped with the BLUE-Key.
