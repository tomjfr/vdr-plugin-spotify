This plugin needs pkg "spotify-client" and a spotify license applied to
the client.

At first start of the the client /usr/bin/spotify from the vdr account
or from the plugin the credentials must be filled in. Correct audio output
should be verified. Only client versions which support dbus will work.

Using a spotify client or app on any device, Playlists can be chosen and
Spotify-Direct can be used to control the vdr-plugin and to listen
to your music on the same device vdr is residing.

Vdr remote commands PLAY, PAUSE, STOP, NEXT, PREVIOUS are valid controls,
BLUE will stop the spotifyd-binary and exit the plugin.

If you use graphlcd it should be patched with the patch in patches.

If you compile with USE_GRAPHTFT = 1, you should copy the script
spotifycopycover.sh to /usr/local/bin. This allows to display the album-arts in
a graphtft-window. Graphtft needs a theme, which recognizes SPOT (see
example in scripts)
