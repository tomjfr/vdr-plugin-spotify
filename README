This plugin needs the rust-implementation "spotifyd" from github and a
premium spotify license.
spotifyd must be created with the feature dbus_mpris and - if you prefer
pulse to alsa - with feature pulse-audio

You should create a spotifyd.conf in plugins/spotifyd and fill the
credentials, the output (alsa or pulse), a specific device name. See
config/spotifyd.conf.

Using any spotify client or app, Playlists can be chosen and Spotify-Direct
can be used to control the vdr-plugin and to listen to your music on the same
device vdr is residing.

You should get a development-cliend-id from spotify and put
SPOTIFYD_CLIEND_ID=xxxxxxx
into vdr's session_environment.

The plugin needs the script scripts/vdr-spotify-onevent.sh in
/usr/local/bin

Vdr remote commands PLAY, PAUSE, STOP, NEXT, PREVIOUS are valid controls,
BLUE will stop the spotifyd-binary and exit the plugin.

Graphlcd should be patched with the patch in patches.

If you compile with USE_GRAPHTFT = 1, you should copy the script
spotifycopycover.sh to /usr/local/bin. This allows to display the album-arts in
a graphtft-window. Graphtft needs a theme, which recognizes SPOT (see
example in scripts)
